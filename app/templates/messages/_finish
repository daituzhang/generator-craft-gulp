Craft is now installed!

Go to [http://craft.dev:<%= portHost %>/admin] for user setting up

The data base is under port <%= portDb %>

Finally, run `gulp` while working to get all of these perks:

* Sass/Compass auto-compile on save
* JSHint on save
* Browser auto-refresh on save

Before you move the code to staging or production, you should run `gulp build`
to generate minified versions of your CSS, Javascript and images.

Happy building!
